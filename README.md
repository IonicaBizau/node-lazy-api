> A minimalist module for loading API resources when they are used.






## Philosophy


Having a big service API wrapper written in NodeJS, most of people create a `for` loop and load all API files before doing anything. The files are loaded in RAM. So, It's not so RAM friendly to load them this way.

With the `lazy-api` module this issue is fixed. Lazy API loads the file when the API method is called. If an application only uses one file, only that file will be loaded in RAM. The other will not be loaded.













## :cloud: Installation

```sh
# Using npm
npm install --save lazy-api

# Using yarn
yarn add lazy-api
```













## :clipboard: Example



```js
// Dependencies
var LazyApi = require("lazy-api");

var Apis = {};

// Instead of doing
// Apis.some = require("./some");
// we do:
LazyApi(Apis, "some", __dirname + "/some");

// And when we will call this method, the file
// will be loaded in the RAM.
Apis.some.method({foo: "bar"}, function (err, d) {
    console.log(err || d);
});

// What if we need to run some custom handlers?
LazyApi.returnHandler = function (path, name, scope) {
    console.log("Loading " + path);
    return require(path);
};

// "Load" (but not in RAM) the another file
LazyApi(Apis, "another", __dirname + "/another");

// Call the method (this will load the file)
Apis.another.method({foo: "bar"}, function (err, d) {
    console.log(err || d);
});

// Call the method again (the file is already loaded);
Apis.another.method({foo: "bar"}, function (err, d) {
    console.log(err || d);
});
```

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects
I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:


 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
